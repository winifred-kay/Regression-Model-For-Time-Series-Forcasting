# Regression-Model-For-Time-Series-Forcasting
Regression model to predict product sales using the Corporation Favorita Products
# Introduction

The development of machine learning has been effectively applied to solve problems in everyday life. Humans are becoming more and more inventive as time passes thanks to the knowledge of the potential applications of machine learning. In the real world, forecasting seems to be where machine learning is most frequently used.Businesses predict product demand, which is a typical job for data scientists. For grocery stores, forecasts are especially important because they must carefully balance how much inventory to purchase. If you overestimate, grocery stores will be stuck with extra perishables. If you make a slight error, popular items will sell out quickly, costing you money and upsetting your customers. Machine learning's improved forecasting capabilities may help retailers please customers by stocking just the right amount of the right products at the right time.

# Aim
Biuld a model that accurately predict store sales on data from Corporation Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.
The model should be able to predict the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores.

# About dataset
The prediction model is designed on the a train data with colmuns below
 0   id           int64  
 1   date         object 
 2   store_nbr    int64  
 3   family       object 
 4   sales        float64
 5   onpromotion   int64  

# Setup/Tools
To run this file, you need python installed with scikit learn and pandas.
